## Installation

This section is a work in-progress, just dropping some quick notes in so that I don't forget.

### Global Styles

If you don't use the included `<SiteLayout />` component, you'll need include it in your app's common layout.

```
import { GlobalStyles } from '@ebinion/zeke-design-system'
```
